## You should edit maps.txt to match your configuration when you enable this.

## Map rotate chance delta
## This is the chance of map rotation factored to the round length.
## A value of 1 would mean the map rotation chance is the round length in minutes (hour long round == 60% rotation chance)
## A value of 0.5 would mean the map rotation chance is half of the round length in minutes (hour long round == 30% rotation chance)

## GENERATE_MINIMAPS
## Generating minimaps(For crew monitor) is slow and bogs down testing, so its disabled by default and must be enabled by uncommenting this config if you are running a production server.
